## Overview

This repository contains OWL (Web Ontology Language) files organized into two primary directories: `KBs` and `Individuals`. Each directory is subdivided into four country-specific subdirectories: **Italy**, **Spain**, **Switzerland**, and **United Kingdom**.

- The `KBs` directory contains OWL files representing both **concepts** (ontology) and **individuals** (instances) for any of the 172 value chains.
- The `Individuals` directory focuses specifically on OWL files defining **individuals** for each value chain.

## How to Use the Repository

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prate91/172_storymaps.git
   ```

2. **Explore the directories**:
   - In the `KBs` directory, access both ontology (concepts) and instance (individual) OWL files for each value chain.
   - In the `Individuals` directory, focus on more granular OWL files containing only individual instances for each value chain.

3. **Open OWL files** using an ontology editor such as [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/), an open-source ontology editor for working with OWL files.

4. **View, edit, or query** the OWL files to work with the knowledge models and individual instances for the specific value chains.
